Run the MiniMony web app (for Live Share guests)
===============================================

If you're joining this Codespace via Live Share in a browser, open
the file `run_flask.py` and press the editor's "Run" button. That
will start the Flask web app (the original script is
`src/gui/web/main.py`).

Alternately, in a terminal run:

```bash
python run_flask.py
```

The app listens on the default Flask development server (localhost).
If you need to expose the port to the Live Share session or Codespace
ports panel, open the integrated Ports view and forward the port
Flask reports (usually 5000).
